                </h3>
                   <p> Some people walk into a room with a smile
                    A smile with their identity written all over it </p>

                   <p> My identity is embedded in my art. 
                    I cling to it.
                    Show it off like a character witness.</p>

                    <p>However the true witnesses are my friends.
                    My dearest oldest friends.
                    So old i can't remember how when we first spoke.
                    So dear they read my mind before i even speak.</p>

                    <p>I forgot how to speak.
                    But admittedly I was never good at it.</p>

                    <p>But i try , sometimes.
                    And every time the fear keeps me frozen in time.</p>

                    <p>Fear will shrink me down to the size of a small, awkward, buck teeth, frizzy haired, chubby little girl ,surrounded by stares and laughter.</p>

                    Fear will make me doubt myself , my worth and my mind. 

                    Fear brings about the ultimate embarrassment, feeling embarrassed.</p>

                   <p> I scream silently.
                    My words seem to only appear on paper and pretty pictures on the walls
                    Every compliment feels like acceptance.</p>

                   <p> Soon my words will hit their target;
                    But i must first win this war against a ghost.</p>

                   <p> When i win, old relationships of tomorrow will be today's new

                    <a href="#">Waiting to be 111</a>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When I was 11</p>
                   <p> I didn't know a lot about the world around me, 
                    But I knew how to embody nothing.</p>
                   <p> A nobody with none to tell me I'm somebody.</p> 
                   <p> My parents are religious and taught me how to pray for riches but never for a reason.</p>
                    <p>All I wanted was for something to give.
                    With nothing to give I wanted to die,
                    but with such a  death came hell and hell meant something worse than this and I couldn't live like that.</p>


                   <p> One lucky day somebody gave me a gift. 
                    They showed me happiness.</p>
                    I took that happiness found its value and made  something meant to give 
                   <p> I was really good at giving it,with everything I gave a part of me was an accessory.
                    Receiving a gift meant that a somebody thought I was a somebody too.
                    I wasn't sure who was that somebody they saw 
                    I needed to find out so I looked. 
                    What I found was that every somebody had a something that made them special 
                    I took these things and I called them mine 
                    That's who I became .....a lie .</p>


                    <p>It took me a while to smell it but my bullshit started to stink and it smeared all over my value. 
                    I didn't find what I was looking for so I had to look again bit this time in a new direction.
                    With this new perspective I met new somebodys and saw things that fit.
                    I'm still looking around but it's okay. </p>
                    <p>I know one day I'll see it </p>
                    <p>Maybe when I'm 111</p>

                <p>
                    That fine line between too much, just enough and too little </p>
                    <p> The distinction between infatuated and obsessed </p>
                    <p> The difference between lustful and loving thoughts</p>
                     <p>All the things I thought I knew before he showed me I was wrong </p>

                     <p>To resent.
                        To ha.
                        To need. 
                        All the things I thought I've felt until he lied, until he left. 
                     <p>I blamed him.
                         I thought I was being unjustly being punished .
                         And that he strategically placed hatred and fury in my heart.
                         Alas I was wrong again.</p>

                    <p> I was delusional.
                     I was ignorant and innocent at hear.
                     He cheated me.
                     He used me.
                     He took advantage and betrayed me.
                     But it was me </p>

                    <p> I was naive.
                         I wasn't questioning .
                         I let imagination and hope change my reality.
                         But most of all.
                        I wanted revenge.
                        I refused to forget.
                        I reminded myself everyday of how bad it hurts.
                        I wanted blood.</p>

                    <p> After that , I gave him a second chance
                    But this time was better. 
                    Of course he lied again, betrayed me again </p>

                    <p> But this time.
                     I chose to leave. 
                     I showed forgiveness.
                     I won't forget but I will never dwell again.
                     I refuse to be blind and broken</p>
